Welcome to Combat Chess!
In this local, two-player game, you play a slightly more gritty and realistic version of chess. 
The game begins as normal chess, the first player to go is white, the second player is black.
Both players are to choose a piece to move and the new location of that piece. Be careful, as just like in the real battlefield, mistakes will cost you.
In the event that the new location of your vassal is occupied by the enemy, you will enter a COMBAT SCENARIO.
In it, you and your opponents will be presented with attack options. You will take turns viscously attack each other until one piece dies.
This allows a pawn to possibly defeat an attacking queen!
The game ends when the King dies in a combat scenario.
If at any point the game must end, enter -1 as the next input enter 'Y' or 'y'. 
Now, go get a friend (or enemy) and have some fun!
